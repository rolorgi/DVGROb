# Direct Voxel Grid Robust Optimization (DVGROb)
Academic Geometry Processing project for the Deep Learning and Applied Artificial Intelligence course.

The aim of this project is to reconstruct the 3D structure of the spheroids from their flawed 2D images using Neural Networks (NN).
We start with DVGO, a NeRF-based NN modified to achieve extremely faster results, and integrate RobustNeRF in it to make it robust to images artifacts that are inevitabily created in the process of spheroid photography.
